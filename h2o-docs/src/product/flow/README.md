##Getting Help 
---

First, let's go over the basics. Type `h` to view a list of helpful shortcuts. 

The following help window displays: 

![help menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h2oai/h2o/master/docs/Flow-images/Shortcuts.png)

To close this window, click the **X** in the upper-right corner, or click the **Close** button in the lower-right corner. You can also click behind the window to close it. 

For additional help, select the **Help** sidebar to the right and click the **Assist Me!** button. 

![Assist Me](images/Flow_AssistMeButton.png) 

You can also type `assist` in a blank cell and press **Ctrl+Enter**. A list of common tasks displays to help you find the correct command. 

 ![Assist Me links](images/Flow_assist.png)
 
You can also access the quick start guide, keyboard shortcuts, or H2O documentation from the "Help" menu at the top of the screen. 

Before getting started with H2O Flow, make sure you understand the different cell modes. 

---

<a name="Cell"></a>
##Understanding Cell Modes

There are two modes for cells: edit and command. In edit mode, the cell is yellow with a blinking bar to indicate where text can be entered and there is an orange flag to the left of the cell.

![Edit Mode](images/Flow_EditMode.png)
 
 In command mode, the flag is yellow. The flag also indicates the cell's format: 

- **MD**: Markdown 
   
   **Note**: Markdown formatting is not applied until you run the cell by clicking the **Run** button or clicking the **Run** menu and selecting **Run**. 

 ![Flow - Markdown](images/Flow_markdown.png)

- **CS**: Code

 ![Flow - Code](images/Flow_parse_code_ex.png)

- **RAW**: Raw format (for code comments)

 ![Flow - Raw](images/Flow_raw.png)

- **H[1-5]**: Heading level (where 1 is a first-level heading)

 ![Flow - Heading Levels](images/Flow_headinglevels.png)

**NOTE**: If there is an error in the cell, the flag is red. 

 ![Cell error](images/Flow_redflag.png)
 
 If the cell is executing commands, the flag is teal. The flag returns to yellow when the task is complete. 
 
 ![Cell executing](images/Flow_cellmode_runningflag.png)

Here are some important keyboard shortcuts to remember: 

- Click a cell and press **Enter** to enter edit mode, which allows you to change the contents of a cell. 
- To exit edit mode, press **Esc**. 
- To execute the contents of a cell, press the **Ctrl** and **Enter** buttons at the same time.

The following commands must be entered in command mode.  

- To add a new cell *above* the current cell, press **a**. 
- To add a new cell *below* the current cell, press **b**. 
- To delete the current cell, press the **d** key *twice*. (**dd**). 

You can view these shortcuts by clicking **Help** > **Keyboard Shortcuts** or by clicking the **Help** tab in the sidebar. 

There are also a series of buttons at the top of the page below the flow name that allow you to save the current flow, add a new cell, move cells up or down, run the current cell, and cut, copy, or paste the current cell. If you hover over the button, a description of the button's function displays. 

 ![Flow buttons](images/Flow_buttons.png)
 
You can also use the menus at the top of the screen to edit the cells, view specific format types (such as input or output), change the cell's format, or run the cell. You can also access troubleshooting information or obtain help with Flow.  
 ![Flow menus](images/Flow_menus.png)


Now that you are familiar with the cell modes, let's import some data. 

---

<a name="ImportData"></a>
##Importing Data

If you don't have any of your own data to work with, you can find some example datasets here: 

- <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/resources/publicdata.html"  target="_blank">http://docs.h2o.ai/resources/publicdata.html </a>
- <a href="http://data.h2o.ai" target="_blank">http://data.h2o.ai</a>


There are multiple ways to import data in H2O flow:

- Click the **Assist Me!** button in the **Help** sidebar, then click the **importFiles** link. Enter the file path in the auto-completing **Search** entry field and press **Enter**. Select the file from the search results and select it by clicking the **Add All** link.
 
  You can also drag and drop the file onto the **Search** field in the cell.
  
 ![Flow - Import Files](images/Flow_Import_DragDrop.png)

- In a blank cell, select the CS format, then enter `importFiles [ "path/filename.format" ]` (where `path/filename.format` represents the complete file path to the file, including the full file name. 

After selecting the file to import, the file path displays in the "Search Results" section. To import a single file, click the plus sign next to the file. To import all files in the search results, click the **Add all** link. The files selected for import display in the "Selected Files" section. 

 ![Import Files](images/Flow_import.png)

- To import the selected file(s), click the **Import** button. 

- To remove all files from the "Selected Files" list, click the **Clear All** link. 

- To remove a specific file, click the **X** next to the file path. 

After you click the **Import** button, the raw code for the current job displays. A summary displays the results of the file import, including the number of imported files and their Network File System (nfs) locations. 

 ![Import Files - Results](images/Flow_import_results.png)

Ok, now that you've imported your data, let's move on to the next step: parsing. Click the **Parse these files** button to continue. 

---

<a name="ParseData"></a>
##Parsing Data

After you have imported your data, parse the data.

Select the parser type (if necessary) from the drop-down **Parser** list. For most data parsing, H2O automatically recognizes the data type, so the default settings typically do not need to be changed. The following options are available: 

- Auto
- XLS
- CSV
- SVMLight

If a separator or delimiter is used, select it from the **Separator** list. 

Select a column header option, if applicable: 

- **Auto**: Automatically detect header types.
- **First row contains column names**: Specify heading as column names.
- **First row contains data**: Specify heading as data. This option is selected by default.

Select any necessary additional options: 

- **Enable single quotes as a field quotation character**: Treat single quote marks (also known as apostrophes) in the data as a character, rather than an enum. This option is not selected by default. 
- **Delete on done**: Check this checkbox to delete the imported data after parsing. This option is selected by default. 

A preview of the data displays in the "Data Preview" section. 
 ![Flow - Parse options](images/Flow_parse_setup.png)

**Note**: To change the column type, select the drop-down list at the top of the column and select the data type. The options are: 
  - Unknown
  - Numeric
  - Enum
  - Time
  - UUID
  - String
  - Invalid


After making your selections, click the **Parse** button. 


After you click the **Parse** button, the code for the current job displays. 

 ![Flow - Parse code](images/Flow_parse_code_ex.png)
 
Since we've submitted a couple of jobs (data import & parse) to H2O now, let's take a moment to learn more about jobs in H2O.  
 
--- 
 
<a name="ViewJobs"></a>
##Viewing Jobs

Any command (such as `importFiles`) you enter in H2O is submitted as a job, which is associated with a key. The key identifies the job within H2O and is used as a reference. 

###Viewing Recent Jobs

To view all recent jobs, click the **Admin** menu, then click **Jobs**, or enter `getJobs` in a cell in CS mode. 

 ![View Jobs](images/Flow_getJobs.png)

The following information displays: 

- Key (linked to the specified job)
- Description of the type of job (for example, `GLM` or `Parse`)
- Status (`RUNNING` or `DONE`)

###Viewing Specific Jobs

To view a specific job, click the **Destination Key** link. 

![View Job - Model](images/Flow_ViewJob_Model.png)

The following information displays: 

- Current status
- Key (for example, `$0301ac10021432d4ffffffff$_8590b37303844cca7c603512c4064b04`)
- Destination key, which is linked to the originally imported data set (for example, AirlinesTest.hex)
- Run time
- Progress

To refresh this information, click the **Refresh** button. To view the details of the job, click the **View** button. 

**NOTE**: For a better understanding of how jobs work, make sure to review the [Viewing Frames](#ViewFrames) section as well. 
 
Ok, now that you understand how to find jobs in H2O, let's submit a new one by building a model.
