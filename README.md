H2O
========

H2O makes Hadoop do math! H2O scales statistics, machine learning and math over BigData. H2O is extensible and users can build blocks using simple math legos in the core. H2O keeps familiar interfaces like R, Excel & JSON so that BigData enthusiasts & experts can explore, munge, model and score datasets using a range of simple to advanced algorithms. Data collection is easy. Decision making is hard. H2O makes it fast and easy to derive insights from your data through faster and better predictive modeling. H2O has a vision of online scoring and modeling in a single platform.

Product Vision for first cut
------------------------------
H2O product, the Analytics Engine will scale Classification and Regression.
- RandomForest, Gradient Boosted Methods (GBM), Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM), Deep Learning and K-Means available over R / REST / JSON-API
- Basic Linear Algebra as building blocks for custom algorithms
- High predictive power of the models
- High speed and scale for modeling and scoring over BigData

Data Sources
- We read and write from/to HDFS, S3, NoSQL, SQL
- We ingest data in CSV format from local and distributed filesystems (nfs)
- A JDBC driver for SQL and DataAdapters for NoSQL datasources is in the roadmap. (v2)

Console provides Adhoc Data Analytics at scale via R-like Parser on BigData
 - Able to pass and evaluate R-like expressions, slicing and filters make this the most powerful web calculator on BigData

Users
--------------------------------
Primary users are Data Analysts looking to wield a powerful tool for Data Modeling in the Real-Time. Microsoft Excel, R, SAS wielding Data Analysts and Statisticians.
Hadoop users with data in HDFS will have a first class citizen for doing Math in Hadoop ecosystem.
Java and Math engineers can extend core functionality by using and extending legos in a simple java that reads like math. See package hex.
Extensibility can also come from writing R expressions that capture your domain.

Design
--------------------------------

We use the best execution framework for the algorithm at hand. For first cut parallel algorithms: Map Reduce over distributed fork/join framework brings fine grain parallelism to distributed algorithms.
Our algorithms are cache oblivious and fit into the heterogeneous datacenter and laptops to bring best performance.
Distributed Arraylets & Data Partitioning to preserve locality.
Move code, not data, not people.

Extensions
---------------------------------

One of our first powerful extension will be a small tool belt of stats and math legos for Fraud Detection. Dealing with Unbalanced Datasets is a key focus for this.
Users will use JSON/REST-api via H2O.R through connects the Analytics Engine into R-IDE/RStudio.

Using H2O Dev Artifacts
--------------------------------
Every nightly build publishes R, python, java and scala artifacts to a per-build repository.  In particular, you can find java artifacts in the maven/repo directory.

Here is an example snippet of a gradle build file using h2o-dev as a dependency.  Replace x, y, z, and nnnn with valid numbers.

```
// h2o-dev dependency information
def h2oBranch = 'master'
def h2oBuildNumber = 'nnnn'
def h2oProjectVersion = "x.y.z.${h2oBuildNumber}"

repositories {
  // h2o-dev dependencies
  maven {
    url "https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/h2o-dev/${h2oBranch}/${h2oBuildNumber}/maven/repo/"
  }
}

dependencies {
  compile "ai.h2o:h2o-core:${h2oProjectVersion}"
  compile "ai.h2o:h2o-algos:${h2oProjectVersion}"
  compile "ai.h2o:h2o-web:${h2oProjectVersion}"
  compile "ai.h2o:h2o-app:${h2oProjectVersion}"
}
```

See the latest H2O Dev [nightly build page](http://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/h2o-dev/master/latest.html) for information about installing nightly build artifacts.

See the [h2o-droplets github repository](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-droplets) for a working example of how to use java artifacts with gradle.

> Note: Stable H2O Dev artifacts are periodically published to Maven Central ([click here to search](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cai.h2o)) but may lag substantially behind H2O Dev Bleeding Edge nightly builds.

Building H2O Dev
--------------------------------

Getting started with H2O development requires JDK 1.7, Node.js, and Gradle.  We use the Gradle wrapper (called `gradlew`) to ensure an up-to-date local version of Gradle and other dependencies are installed in your development directory.

### For all Platforms:

##### Install required python packages (using `sudo` if necessary)

    `pip install grip`
    `pip install tabulate`
    `pip install wheel`

### For Windows

##### Step 1: Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.9/python-2.7.9.amd64.msi) for Windows. 
  From the command line, validate `python` is using the newly-installed package. [Update the Environment variable](https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html#excursus-setting-environment-variables) with the Python path.
  
  `C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\`

###### Step 2: Install required Python packages:

    `pip install grip`
    `pip install tabulate`
    `pip install wheel`

##### Step 3: Install JDK

Install [Java 1.7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) and add the appropriate directory `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_65\bin` with java.exe to PATH in Environment Variables. To make sure the command prompt is detecting the correct Java version, run:

    javac -version

##### Step 4. Install Node.js, npm, and bower

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) and add the installed directory `C:\Program Files\nodejs`, which must include node.exe and npm.cmd to PATH if not already prepended. After installing Node.js, install bower using:

    npm install -g bower

##### Step 5. Install R, the required packages, and Rtools:

To install these packages from within an R session, enter:

    R> install.packages("RCurl")
    R> install.packages("rjson")
    R> install.packages("statmod")
    R> install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat"))

Install [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and add the preferred bin\i386 or bin\x64 directory to your PATH.

Note: Acceptable versions of R are >= 2.13 && <= 3.0.0 && >= 3.1.1.

To manually install packages, download the releases of the following R packages: [bitops](http://cran.r-project.org/package=bitops), [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools), [digest](http://cran.r-project.org/package=digest), [Rcpp](http://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp), [RCurl](http://cran.r-project.org/package=RCurl), [rjson](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rjson), [roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), [statmod](http://cran.r-project.org/package=statmod), [stringr](http://cran.r-project.org/package=stringr), and [testthat](http://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat).

    cd Downloads
    R CMD INSTALL bitops_x.x-x.zip
    R CMD INSTALL RCurl_x.xx-x.x.zip
    R CMD INSTALL rjson_x.x.xx.zip
    R CMD INSTALL statmod_x.x.xx.zip
    R CMD INSTALL Rcpp_x.xx.x.zip
    R CMD INSTALL digest_x.x.x.zip
    R CMD INSTALL testthat_x.x.x.zip
    R CMD INSTALL stringr_x.x.x.zip
    R CMD INSTALL roxygen2_x.x.x.zip
    R CMD INSTALL devtools_x.x.x.zip


Finally, install [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), which is a collection of command line tools to facilitate R development on Windows.
**NOTE**: During Rtools installation, do **not** install Cygwin.dll.

##### Step 6. Install [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe)
**NOTE**: During installation of Cygwin, deselect the Python packages to avoid a conflict with the Python.org package. 

###### Step 6b. Validate Cygwin
If Cygwin is already installed, remove the Python packages or ensure that Native Python is before Cygwin in the PATH variable. 

##### Step 7. Update or validate the Windows PATH variable to include R, Java JDK, Cygwin. 

##### Step 8. Git Clone [h2o-dev](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-dev.git)

If you don't already have a Git client, please install one.  The default one can be found here http://git-scm.com/downloads .  Make sure that during the install command prompt support is turned on.

Download and update h2o-dev source codes:

    git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-dev

##### Step 9. Run the top-level gradle build:

    cd h2o-dev
    gradlew.bat build

> If you encounter errors run again with `--stacktrace` for more instructions on missing dependencies.


### Setup on OS X

If you don't have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), we recommend installing it.  It makes package management for OS X easy.

##### Step 1. Install JDK

Install [Java 1.7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html). To make sure the command prompt is detecting the correct Java version, run:

    javac -version

##### Step 2. Install Node.js, npm, and bower:

Using Homebrew:

    brew install node

Otherwise, install from the [NodeJS website](http://nodejs.org/download/). After you have installed Node.js, install bower using

    npm install -g bower

##### Step 3. Install R and the required packages:

Install [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and add the bin directory to your PATH if not already included.

Install the following R packages: [RCurl](http://cran.r-project.org/package=RCurl), [rjson](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rjson), [statmod](http://cran.r-project.org/package=statmod), [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools), [roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) and [testthat](http://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat).

    cd Downloads
    R CMD INSTALL bitops_x.x-x.tgz
    R CMD INSTALL RCurl_x.xx-x.x.tgz
    R CMD INSTALL rjson_x.x.xx.tgz
    R CMD INSTALL statmod_x.x.xx.tgz
    R CMD INSTALL Rcpp_x.xx.x.tgz
    R CMD INSTALL digest_x.x.x.tgz
    R CMD INSTALL testthat_x.x.x.tgz
    R CMD INSTALL stringr_x.x.x.tgz
    R CMD INSTALL roxygen2_x.x.x.tgz
    R CMD INSTALL devtools_x.x.x.tgz

To install these packages from within an R session:

    R> install.packages("RCurl")
    R> install.packages("rjson")
    R> install.packages("statmod")
    R> install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat"))

##### Step 4. Git Clone [h2o-dev](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-dev.git)

OS X should have with Git installed. To download and update h2o-dev source codes:

    git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-dev

##### Step 5. Run the top-level gradle build:

    cd h2o-dev
    ./gradlew build

> If you encounter errors run again with `--stacktrace` for more instructions on missing dependencies.

### Setup on Ubuntu 14.04

##### Step 1. Install Node.js, npm, and bower:

    sudo apt-get install npm
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
    npm install -g bower

##### Step 2. Install JDK:

Install [Java 1.7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html). Installation instructions can be found here [JDK installation](http://askubuntu.com/questions/56104/how-can-i-install-sun-oracles-proprietary-java-jdk-6-7-8-or-jre). To make sure the command prompt is detecting the correct Java version, run:

    javac -version

##### Step 3. Git Clone [h2o-dev](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-dev.git)

If you don't already have a Git client:

    sudo apt-get install git

Download and update h2o-dev source codes:

    git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-dev

##### Step 4. Run the top-level gradle build:

    cd h2o-dev
    ./gradlew build

> If you encounter errors run again with `--stacktrace` for more instructions on missing dependencies.

> Make sure that you are not running as root, since `bower` will reject such a run.

### Setup on Ubuntu 13.10

##### Step 1. Install Node.js, npm, and bower

On Ubuntu 13.10, the default Node.js (v0.10.15) is sufficient, but the default npm (v1.2.18) is too old, so use a fresh install from the npm website:

    sudo apt-get install node
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
    wget http://npmjs.org/install.sh
    sudo apt-get install curl
    sudo sh install.sh
    npm install -g bower

##### Steps 2-4. Follow steps 2-4 for Ubuntu 14.04

### Setting up your preferred build environment

For users of Intellij's IDEA, generate project files with:

    ./gradlew idea

For users of Eclipse, generate project files with:

    ./gradlew eclipse


H2O on Hadoop
-------------

To build H2O with Hadoop support, do the following from the top-level h2o-dev directory:

    (export BUILD_HADOOP=1; ./gradlew build -x test)
    ./gradlew dist


This will create a directory called 'target' and generate zip files there.    


### Adding support for a new version of Hadoop

In the h2o-hadoop directory each hadoop version has a build directory for the driver and an assembly directory for the fatjar.

You need to:

1.  Add a new driver directory and assembly directorie (each with a build.gradle file) in h2o-hadoop
2.  Add these new projects to h2o-dev/settings.gradle
3.  Add the new hadoop version to HADOOP_VERSIONS in make-dist.sh
4.  Add the new hadoop version to wget list in h2o-dist/index.html



Sparkling Water
---------------------------------
Sparkling Water combines two open source technologies: Apache Spark and H2O, our machine learning engine.  It makes H2O’s library of Advanced Algorithms, including Deep Learning, GLM, GBM, KMeans, PCA, and Random Forest, accessible from Spark workflows. Spark users are provided with options to select the best features from either platforms to meet their Machine Learning needs.  Users can combine Sparks’ RDD API and Spark MLLib with H2O’s machine learning algorithms, or use H2O independent of Spark in the model building process and post-process the results in Spark. 

### Prerequisites

Spark 1.2 for Sparkling Water v0.2.4-65+
Spark 1.1 for older versions

### Sparkling Water on Hadoop

Compatiable Hadoop Distributions: CDH4, CDH5, and HDP2.1.

#### Install on Hadoop

- To install on your Hadoop Cluster clone the git repository and make a build:

```
git clone https://github.com/0xdata/sparkling-water.git 
cd sparkling-water
./gradlew build
```

- Then set MASTER to the IP address of where your Spark Master Node is launched and set SPARK_HOME to the location of your Spark installation. In the example below the path for SPARK_HOME is the default location of Spark preinstalled on a CDH5 cluster. Please change MASTER below:

```
export MASTER="spark://mr-0xd9-precise1.0xdata.loc:7077"
export SPARK_HOME="/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-5.2.0-1.cdh5.2.0.p0.11/lib/spark"
```

- Launch Sparkling Shell:

```
./bin/sparkling-shell
```

#### Import Data from HDFS

The initialization of H2O remains the same with the exception of importing data from a HDFS path. Please change path variable below to one suitable for your data.

```scala
import org.apache.spark.h2o._
import org.apache.spark.examples.h2o._
// Create H2O context
val h2oContext = new H2OContext(sc).start()
// Export H2O context to the 
import h2oContext._

// URI to access HDFS file
val path = "hdfs://mr-0xd6-precise1.0xdata.loc:8020/datasets/airlines_all.05p.csv"
val d = new java.net.URI(path)
val f = new DataFrame(d)
```
